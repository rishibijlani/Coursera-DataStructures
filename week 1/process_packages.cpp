/*
 store in the list or queue finish_time the times when the computer will
finish processing the packets which are currently stored in the network buffer, in increasing order. When
a new packet arrives, you will first need to pop from the front of finish_time all the packets which are
already processed by the time new packet arrives. Then you try to add the finish time for the new packet in
finish_time. If the buffer is full (there are already ùëÜ finish times in finish_time), the packet is dropped.
Otherwise, its processing finish time is added to finish_time.

If finish_time is empty when a new packet arrives, computer will start processing the new packet
immediately as soon as it arrives. Otherwise, computer will start processing the new packet as soon as it
finishes to process the last of the packets currently in finish_time (here is when you need to access the
last element of finish_time to determine when the computer will start to process the new packet). You will
also need to compute the processing finish time by adding ùëÉùëñ to the processing start time and push it to the
back of finish_time.
